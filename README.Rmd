*J.R.R. Tolkien once said:*

>“All that is gold does not glitter,
>not all those who wander are lost;
>the old that is strong does not wither,
>deep roots are not reached by the frost.

>From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
>a light from the shadows shall spring;
>renewed shall be blade that was broken,
>the crownless again shall be king.”
